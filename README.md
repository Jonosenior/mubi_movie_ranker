# Mubi Movie Ranker

## Description

Mubi Movie Ranker ranks the films available on Mubi by their Rotten Tomatoes rating.

Mubi is an amazing Netflix alternative which focuses on international Arthouse cinema. Every day a new film is added, and is available to watch for 30 days. There are always 30 films available.

Often, I have no idea which film to watch, so I google around to see which is the 'best' film currently on offer. This project does this automatically - it scrapes the Mubi site for the films currently showing, runs them through the Rotten Tomatoes API, and ranks them according to their Rotten Tomatoes rating.

This way, if you don't know what to watch, you can watch the best film that Mubi is currently showing.
